## üìä Methodology

### üìÅ Data
- Collected and compiled manually over 6 weeks
- Fields include: `Company Name`, `Job Title`, `Skills`, `Salary`, `Experience`, `Week`

### üßπ Data Cleaning (via SQL)
- Converted `Experience` field from strings to integers, replacing "Intern" with NULL then backfilled
- Split comma-separated `Skills` into individual rows using a recursive CTE
- Normalized data types for consistency (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `INT`)

### üìà Analysis Performed
- **Experience-wise Vacancy Count**  
  Tracked how job openings vary with years of experience

- **Skill Frequency Analysis**  
  Used recursive SQL to split and count individual skills across listings

- **Experience vs Salary Breakdown**  
  Aggregated average, max, and min salary by experience level

- **Company-wise Salary Analysis**  
  Ranked companies by average salary offered

- **Weekly Posting Trends**  
  Job counts grouped by week for hiring trend analysis
